Google2SRT 0.7 - 27/10/2014
* Support for multiple videos when specified in a text file with a URL list (one URL per line).
* GUI uses system look and feel so it looks like "another normal application".
* Output filename can contain the title of the video.
* Output is now a directory and filename is completely autogenerated, which is more intuitive.
* Last settings for language, output path, XML input path, +Track and +Title are saved between sessions.
* Simplified interface: multiple translations from multiples tracks from multiple videos can be converted by using both tabs.
* Minor graphical changes: added application icon, window is centered and resizable, columns are sortable, added multi-message textarea, etc.
* Cleaned up code. Major restructuration. 'Network' class became 'Video'. Most non-graphical logics have been moved from 'GUI' class to 'Controller'.
* Provided Windows Java wrapper: WinRun4j.
* Enhanced "run.bat" for users who still use it. Replaced "java" by "javaw" and JAR launched via "start".
* Built Windows software installer package.

Google2SRT 0.6 - 11/08/2013
* Added ASR support (automatic speech recognition). Thanks JAYZMRT!
